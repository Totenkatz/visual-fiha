An open source browser based VJing tool with MIDI support.

# Aims (and goal)

**Warning:** This section reflects personal opinions and experiences of the original author of this code.  
_You may care or not._

In the early 2000's I use to perform as VJ with a Macromedia Flash software I had to write myself.   
Flash is dead.   
Some advanced and powerful softwares exist now but most of them dont't run on Linux. ðŸ¤·  
And as I want to perform again ([since](https://www.facebook.com/zeropaper/posts/115927868567755) [a long time](https://github.com/zeropaper/visual-fiha/commit/3dd8297e8856d86f1db24b4f349d707f34569742))â€¦ I need a new software.

I also realized (discovering [Drupal](https://drupal.org) at a time I tried to create a XML/XSL based CMS) that a developer alone can do great things but together _we rock_.

And whateverâ€¦ I want the perfect tool and I don't mind sharing.

## Goal

My goals (and I hope yours is similar) is to produce an easy to develop, intuitive, verstatile, interactive and high quality software.  
Visually, I am into vector design and I am focusing on SVG support but I plan to add some utilities for 3D libraries (like three.js).

# Installation

[No need to install, open Google Chrome and enjoy.](https://zeropaper.github.io/visual-fiha)

## Seriously?

Well, if you do more than playing around with the [demo site](https://zeropaper.github.io/visual-fiha) and need to have your own assets (videos, images, 3d models or vetcor designs), you may have a look at the [developement wiki](https://github.com/zeropaper/visual-fiha/wiki/Development).

# Usage

See the [usage guide in the wiki](https://github.com/zeropaper/visual-fiha/wiki/Usage).

# Browser support

For now, development is focused on the latest version Google Chrome.   
Firefox is a decent browser but behaves too slowly and does not support the WebMIDI API. ðŸ¤·  
Browsers from Mircosoft or Apple, even the latest versions, do not deserve attention.  

# Development

See the [development guide in the wiki](https://github.com/zeropaper/visual-fiha/wiki/Development).
