An open source browser based VJing tool with MIDI support.

# Aims and goals

**Warning:** This section reflects personal opinions and experiences of the original author of this code. You may care or not.

In the early 2000's I use to perform as VJ with a Macromedia Flash software I had to write myself.
Flash is dead.
Some advanced and powerful softwares exist now but most of them dont't run on Linux. ðŸ¤·
And as I want to perform again ([since a long time](https://github.com/zeropaper/visual-fiha/commit/3dd8297e8856d86f1db24b4f349d707f34569742))â€¦ I need a new software.

I also relealized, discovering [Drupal](https://drupal.org) at the time I was trying to create my own XML based CMS, that a developer alone can do great things but together we rock.

And whateverâ€¦ I don't want moneyâ€¦ I want the perfect tool and I don't mind sharing.

## Sustainability

By putting all that stuff in a git repository (and pushing to GitHub from time to timeâ€¦) my goal is to do better than what I did before (and it's easy because I lost most of what I did at the time I started VJing).
